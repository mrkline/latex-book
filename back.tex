\section{For \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX}}

As promised from the start, this book is incomplete.
To keep it short,
major \LaTeX{} features---like figures, captions, tables, graphics,
and bibliographies---haven't been discussed.
Use some of these resources to fill in the gaps:

\textit{The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX}, \\
available at \https{www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/}

\section{For typography}

We've spent most of our time here focusing on \emph{what} you can do with \LaTeX,
and little on \emph{how} you should use it to create well-designed documents.

\chapter{Colophon}

This guide was typeset with \LuaLaTeX{} in Robert Slimbach's Garamond Premier,
a revival of roman type by \otford{16}{th} century French punchcutter
Claude Garamond.
Italics are inspired by the work of Garamond's contemporary Robert Granjon.

Monospaced items are set in \texttt{Drive Mono},
designed by Elliott Amblard and Jérémie Hornus at Black Foundry.

Captions use
\textsf{\small Neue Haas Grotesk},
a Helvetica restoration by Christian Schwartz.
Earlier digitizations of the ubiquitous Swiss typeface are based on fonts
made for Linotype and phototypesetting machines,
resulting in digital versions with needless compromises and kludges from the
two previous generations of printing technology.
Schwartz based his work on Helvetica's original drawings,
producing a design faithful to the original cold metal type.

{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX, Scale=MatchLowercase]{Futura-Boo}URW Futura}
makes a few guest appearances.
Designed by Paul Renner and first released in 1927,
Futura has found itself almost everywhere,
from advertising and political campaigns to the moon.
Douglas Thomas's recent history of the typeface,
{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX, Scale=MatchLowercase]{Futura-Boo}Never Use Futura},
is a fantastic read.

Various bits of non-Latin text are set in
{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX,Scale=MatchLowercase]{NotoSerif-Regular}Noto},
a type family by Google that covers \emph{every} glyph
in the Unicode standard.

Finally,
{\lm Latin Modern}---the OpenType version of Knuth's Computer Modern used throughout
the book---and
{\fontspec[Scale=MatchUppercase]{TeX Gyre Termes}\TeX{} Gyre Termes}---the
free alternative to Times Roman seen on page \pageref{typography}---are the
work of Grupa Użytkowników Systemu \TeX{}, the Polish \TeX{} Users' Group.
