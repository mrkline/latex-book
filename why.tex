\chapter{Typography and You}
\label{typography}

Life is a parade of written language.
Wherever you go,
ads, apps, articles, essays, emails, and messages
shove text in your face.
But when you read that text, you see so much more than the author's
verbiage.
Consciously or not, you notice the shapes and sizes of letters.
You notice how those letters are arranged into words,
how those words are arranged into paragraphs,
how those paragraphs are arranged onto pages and screens.
You notice \introduce{typography}.
% Smoke test: a line should be 2-3 alphabets wide
%\\ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Typography is why these lines evoke memories of awful essays
you wrote in school.
Do many books look this way? Why not?

\noindent There is a reason street signs don't look like this:
\begin{leftfigure}
\fontspec[Scale=MatchUppercase]{KJV1611}\Large E Gorham St.
\end{leftfigure}
And why a very important switch in a spaceship is labeled like this:
\begin{leftfigure}
\fontspec[Scale=MatchUppercase]{Futura-Med}CM/SM SEP
\end{leftfigure}
Not like this:
\begin{leftfigure}
\fontspec{Pinyon Script}\Large CM/SM Sep
\end{leftfigure}

Effective written communication is about the look and layout of words,
not just which ones you choose.
Good typography isn't just art---it's function.
And if you care about any of this,
you should try \LaTeX,\punckern\footnote{Pronounced ``lay-tech''
or ``lah-tech''}
a program for crafting written documents.
By carefully handling subtle details,
it produces beautiful typography with little effort.
Modern versions can also leverage recent\footnote{By recent,
I mean ``from the mid-1990s''\quotekern, but web browsers and desktop publishing
software are only just starting to catch up.} advances in digital typesetting,
offering you the same tools used by professional graphic designers and
publishers.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX}?}

\LaTeX{} is an alternative to ``word processors'' like
Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Google Docs,
and LibreOffice Writer.
These other applications operate on the principle of
\introduce{What You See Is What You Get}
\acronym{(wysiwyg)}, where what's on screen is the same
as what comes out of your printer.
\LaTeX{} is different. Here, documents are written as
``plain'' text files, using \introduce{markup}
to specify how the final result should look.
If you've done any web design, this is a similar
process---just as \acronym{html} and \acronym{css}
describe the page you want browsers to draw,
markup describes the appearance of your document to \LaTeX.

This might seem strange if you haven't worked with markup before,
but it comes with a few advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You can handle your writing's content and its presentation separately.
    At the start of each document,
    you describe the design you want.
    \LaTeX{} takes it from there, consistently formatting your whole text
    the way you asked.
    Compare this to a \acronym{wysiwyg} system,
    where you constantly deal with appearances
    as you write.
    If you changed the look of a caption,
    were you sure to find all the other captions and do the
    same?
    If the program formats something in a way you don't like,
    is it hard to fix?%\footnote{I spent far too much of my childhood
    %fighting with Word about how it wrapped text around images.}

\item You can define your own commands, then tweak them to instantly adjust
    every place they're used.
    For example, the \verb|\introduce| and \verb|\acronym| commands
    from the example paragraph are my own creations.
    The former \introduce{italicizes} text, and the latter sets words in
    \acronym{small caps} with a bit of extra
    \mbox{\textsc{\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=15}letterspacing}} so the characters
    don't look \textsc{\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=-10}too crowded}.
    If I decide that I'd rather introduce new terms
    \textbf{\itshape with this look}, or that acronyms should be displayed
    {\small\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=6} LIKE THIS},
    I just change the two lines that define those commands.
    Everywhere they're used immediately takes on the new look.

\item Being able to save the document as plain text has its own benefits:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It can be read and understood with any text editor.
    \item Structure is immediately visible
        and simple to replicate.\punckern\footnote{Compare this to
        \acronym{wysiwyg} systems, where it's not always obvious
        how certain formatting was produced or how to match it.}
    \item Content is easily generated by scripts and programs.
    \item Changes can be tracked with standard version control software,
        like Git or Mercurial.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Another guide?}

You might wonder why the world needs another guide for \LaTeX{}.
After all, it's been around for decades.
A quick Amazon search finds nearly a dozen books on the topic.
There are plenty of resources online.

Unfortunately, most \LaTeX{} guides have two fatal flaws:
they are long, and they are old.
Beginners don't want---or need---hundreds of pages just to learn the basics,
and older guides waste your time with outdated information.
When \LaTeX{} was first released in 1986, none of the publishing technologies
we use today existed.
Adobe wouldn't debut their Portable Document Format for seven more years,
and desktop publishing was a fledgling curiosity.
This shows---badly---in many \LaTeX{} guides.
If you look for instructions to change your document's font,
you'll get swamped with bespoke nonsense.\punckern\footnote{%
Take the criticisms here with a grain of
salt. After all, the fact that all of the technology around \LaTeX{} became
obsolete---multiple times---is a testament to its staying power.}

The good news is that  \LaTeX{} has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years.
It's time for a guide that doesn't weigh you down with decades of legacy
or try (in vain) to be a comprehensive reference.
After all, you're a smart, resourceful person who knows how to use a
search engine.
This book will:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Teach you the fundamentals of \LaTeX.
\item Point you to places where you can learn more.
\item Show you how to take advantage of modern typesetting technologies.
\item End promptly thereafter.
\end{enumerate}
